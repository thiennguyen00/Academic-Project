2)For this exercise, I used enum class to create the cookie types and cookies size. I also created the constructors for cookies, default constructors, getter functions, operator==, and print() function. An interesting experience for me in this exercise is using enum class.
3) and 4): I created an abstract class Basket to hold those a lot of virtual functions and then override those in a derived class so that I can make objects out of them. I manipulated iterators to iterate through the vectors to count or print the vector. I also used some built-in function for vector such as clear() or size().
5) I repeated the same process in part 3 and 4 except now, I use linked list. I use node to iterate through the list and manipulate data such as adding, deleting, or counting in the loop. 
6)For these, I used iterator to loop through the basket. For copy_basket, I use the add_cookie() function to create a new basket. In merging basket, I do the same thing except I do it twice and then add them up. For intersecting basket, I do the same thing except I first check the condition if they are similar or not. For difference basket, I do the same thing except I check the condition if they are different or not. 
7) I created 2 files so that the two initial basket object would have different data(cookies). And then I implement those functions that I created onto those two cookies.

Note: For the remove function: Because the cookies baskets are random, they might not be activated because the chosen cookies is not in the basket. Also, the bottom part that is commented out in the test_cookie_basket.cpp is part 2, 3, and 4.
